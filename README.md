This is a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application. An Express based framework. It uses MySQL.

Go to config/connections.js to change the configuration of mySQL connection. Change the parameters in 'someMysqlServer'.

After changing the configuration. You should run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies that are in the package.json.

Once you are ready, you can start the server by navigating to the folder in the terminal and then run ```sails lift```.

During starting the server you will get a prompt to choose the type of migration. The first time choose 3, so that you will use the seed data that I provide in the project. If you want to keep the data, choose 1.

If you run into trouble, try installing sails in your computer ```npm install sails -g```.
